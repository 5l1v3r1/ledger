GLOSSARY
----

Developing the Ledger software uses a number different tools, not all of which will be familiar to all developers.

[**Boost**](http://www.boost.org):  a standard set of C++ libraries.  Most Boost libraries consist of inline functions and templates in header files.

[**GCC**](http://gcc.gnu.org):  GNU Compiler Collection, which includes gcc (the compiler) and gcov (coverage and line based performance) tools.

[**GMP**](https://gmplib.org):  Gnu Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library provides arbitrary precision math.

[**Travis CI**](https://travis-ci.org): a hosted continuous integration service that
  builds and runs tests each commit posted to GitHub.  Each build creates
  a [log](https://travis-ci.org/ledger/ledger), updates a [small graphic](https://travis-ci.org/ledger/ledger.png?branch=master) at the top left of
  the main project's
  [README.md](https://github.com/ledger/ledger/blob/master/README.md), and emails the author of the commit if any tests fail.
